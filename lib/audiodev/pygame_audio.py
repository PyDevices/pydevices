"""pygame-ce playback and capture backend for the portable :mod:`audiodev` contract.

Uses **pygame's own SDL** only (never ``usdl2`` / system libSDL2):

- **Playback:** ``SDL_QueueAudio`` via ctypes against pygame-ce's bundled
  ``libSDL2`` — no ``pygame.mixer``, no Python audio callback (avoids the
  GIL+pause deadlock that freezes the UI under WSLg).
- **Capture:** ``pygame._sdl2.AudioDevice`` (callback), with async close.

Mixing SDL libraries is the one thing that must not change: pygame-ce links its
own ``libSDL2``, and driving pygame's devices through ``usdl2``'s copy means two
SDL states in one process. Load the bundled library (:func:`_pygame_sdl`) or use
``sdl2_audio`` instead — never both against the same device.

Before simplifying playback
---------------------------

:class:`PygamePCMOutput` deliberately mirrors ``sdl2_audio.SDLPCMOutput``
mechanism for mechanism: rate-based stall detection, a hardware-only prebuffer
gate, an off-thread rebuild with a settle gap, and a shadow buffer for lossless
recovery. Each exists because the simpler version measurably failed. That module's
docstring records what each one prevents, and ``README.md`` in this directory has
the full account.

Keep the two in step. When a fix lands in one backend it belongs in the other,
because the failure they work around is in the host's audio sink, not in either
library.
