"""SDL2 audio backend for :mod:`audiodev` (pure Python, queued audio only).

Playback pushes PCM with ``SDL_QueueAudio`` and never installs an audio
callback: SDL's audio thread is not registered with the Python/MicroPython
interpreter, so calling back into it from it is unsafe (it segfaults
under MicroPython and fights the GIL under CPython/LVGL).

Four behaviors keep queued playback smooth, all established by measurement on
WSLg/PulseAudio rather than by preference:

* small writes are coalesced (``coalesce_ms``, 100ms by default) before being
  handed to SDL;
* the device stays paused until ``PREBUFFER_MS`` is queued, because starting on
  a nearly empty queue and then starving it makes PulseAudio stop asking for
  data;
* if the device falls far behind realtime, it is reopened and the unplayed PCM is
  re-queued (see ``STALL_WINDOW_MS``);
* that reopen runs on a worker thread, because closing a wedged device blocks for
  over a second and the caller is usually driving a UI.

Before simplifying any of this
------------------------------

Each rule below replaced an obvious, simpler version that measurably failed. The
failure is named so it can be re-tested instead of rediscovered:

* Detect stalls by **consumption rate over a window**, never by watching queue
  depth. A caller that tops the queue up replaces every consumed period before
  the next check sees it, so depth does not fall even when the sink has died.
* Gate the prebuffer on :meth:`SDLPCMOutput._hw_queued`, never on
  :meth:`SDLPCMOutput.queued_size`. Counting bytes still sitting in the
  software buffer let the device start on ~40ms of audio, underrun, and wedge
  again immediately after every recovery.
* Keep the reopen off the caller's thread, and keep ``RECOVER_SETTLE_MS``
  between close and open. A synchronous rebuild stalled the caller's tick for
  ~1.8s; reopening with no gap handed back the same wedged sink and re-stalled
  within seconds, in pairs.
* Size ``_shadow`` to cover everything SDL may still hold. Anything smaller
  silently drops audio during recovery.
* Do not let "the device is unpaused" mean playing in
  :meth:`SDLPCMOutput.is_active` -- it stays unpaused for the life of the
  device, so callers would wait forever for playback that already finished.

The ``recycles``, ``lost_bytes`` and ``requeued_bytes`` counters exist to keep
those claims checkable: a healthy long run recycles rarely and loses nothing.
``README.md`` in this directory has the full account, including how to measure a
change before making it.

This module also runs on MicroPython (unix and ``micropython.exe``) and
CircuitPython, so it avoids CPython-only APIs -- notably it consumes buffers with
``buf[:n] = b""`` rather than ``del buf[:n]``, which those interpreters reject at
runtime, not at import. See "Portability" in ``README.md``; verify changes by
running ``examples/audio_out_test.py`` under all three interpreters.
